## 📘 What This Site Is About

This site is my personal space for documenting what I learn every day — coding, AI, tools, frameworks, concepts, experiments, and anything else that sparks curiosity.

Everything is written in simple Markdown files and automatically published using **GitHub Pages + Jekyll**.

## 📂 How the Site Is Organized

The documentation is structured into clear sections:

- **Daily Learning Logs** – Short notes on what I learned each day  
- **Topics** – Deeper explanations grouped by subject (AI, Web Dev, Tools, etc.)  
- **Guides** – Step‑by‑step tutorials or how‑to notes  
- **Snippets** – Useful commands, code snippets, and references  

You can explore these sections using the sidebar on the left.
