# 🟦 **What AWS Kiro Actually Is**

AWS Kiro is a **full AI IDE** designed for enterprise‑grade software development.  
It’s not just a coding assistant — it’s a complete development environment with:

### ✔ Spec generation  
Kiro converts natural‑language requests into **formal requirements** (often EARS‑style).

### ✔ Architecture modeling  
It proposes system architecture before writing code.

### ✔ Task planning  
Kiro breaks specs into actionable tasks.

### ✔ Multi‑agent execution  
Different agents handle coding, testing, documentation, and infra.

### ✔ Multi‑file editing  
Kiro edits your entire repo intelligently.

### ✔ AWS‑native integration  
CDK, Lambda, IAM, S3, DynamoDB — all deeply integrated.

### ✔ Enterprise workflows  
Audit logs, approvals, governance, compliance.

### ✔ Full IDE + CLI  
A polished desktop IDE plus a powerful terminal agent.

In short:

> **Kiro = AI engineer + architect + project manager + DevOps assistant, all inside one IDE.**

You can ask Continue to generate formal specs.

### ✔ Architecture modeling (prompt‑driven)  
Continue can propose system designs.

### ✔ Works with any LLM  
DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, local models — all supported.

Continue is essentially:

> **The open‑source IDE brain that mirrors Kiro’s IDE capabilities.**

# 🟧 **What Aider CLI Actually Is**

Aider is a **CLI‑first AI coding agent** that edits your repo using precise diffs.

It provides:

### ✔ Multi‑file editing  
Handles complex refactors and feature implementations.

### ✔ Precise diffs  
Shows exactly what will change before applying.

### ✔ Fast iteration  
Perfect for rapid development.

### ✔ Repo‑aware reasoning  
Understands your project structure.

### ✔ Works with any LLM  
DeepSeek works beautifully with Aider.

Aider is essentially:

> **The open‑source CLI agent that mirrors Kiro’s terminal agent.**

# 🟪 **Why Continue.dev + Aider CLI Together ≈ AWS Kiro**

Kiro is a **full stack** of capabilities.  
Continue and Aider each cover different layers of that stack.

Here’s the clean mapping:

| Kiro Capability | Continue.dev | Aider CLI |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Natural‑language → tasks | ✔ | ✔ |
| Multi‑file editing | ✔ | ✔ |
| Repo‑aware reasoning | ✔ | ✔ |
| Spec generation | ✔ (prompt‑driven) | ❌ |
| Architecture modeling | ✔ (prompt‑driven) | ❌ |
| Agentic workflows | ✔ (custom agents) | ✔ (single agent) |
| IDE | ✔ (VS Code/JetBrains) | ❌ |
| CLI | ❌ | ✔ |
| AWS integration | ❌ | ❌ |
| Enterprise workflows | ❌ | ❌ |
| Open‑source | ✔ | ✔ |
| Model choice | Any (DeepSeek) | Any (DeepSeek) |

Together, Continue + Aider replicate **80–90% of Kiro’s capabilities**, except:

- AWS‑native integrations  
- enterprise governance  
- automatic spec/architecture generation (Continue can do it, but manually triggered)

For most developers — especially solo devs, indie hackers, and small teams — Continue + Aider is actually **more flexible** than Kiro.

# 🟦 **Real‑World Example: “Add PDF Export Feature”**

Let’s see how each tool behaves with the same prompt:

> “Add a feature to export all notes to PDF.”

---

## 🟦 **Kiro Workflow**
1. **Spec generation**  
2. **Architecture modeling**  
3. **Task breakdown**  
4. **Multi‑agent execution**  
5. **CDK updates**  
6. **Tests + documentation**

Kiro behaves like a full engineering team.

---

## 🟩 **Continue.dev Workflow**
1. Generate spec (prompt‑driven)  
2. Propose architecture (prompt‑driven)  
3. Multi‑file edits inside IDE  
4. Custom agents for planning or refactoring  

Continue behaves like an AI architect + IDE assistant.

---

## 🟧 **Aider CLI Workflow**
1. Breaks into tasks  
2. Applies multi‑file diffs  
3. Implements the feature  
4. Shows changes before applying  

Aider behaves like an AI engineer in your terminal.
