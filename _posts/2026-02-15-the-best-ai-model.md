# Best AI models for developer with paid subscription and data privacy

## **1. If you want ONLY a coding assistant inside VS Code + IntelliJ →  
DeepSeek API (PAYG) is the best choice.**

Because:

- It’s **far cheaper** than Google or OpenAI  
- It’s **faster** for coding tasks  
- It’s **more accurate** for code generation, debugging, refactoring  
- It’s **privacy‑safe** (API data not used for training)  
- You only pay for what you use  
- Monthly cost for your usage will be **₹50–₹150**, not ₹1,590  

This is the most cost‑efficient and developer‑friendly option for a **coding‑only** workflow.

## **2. If you want an all‑in‑one package (coding + chat + images + videos + mobile app) →  
Google Gemini Advanced (₹1,590/month) is the best choice.**

Because:

- It includes **Gemini Code Assist** for VS Code + IntelliJ  
- It includes **Imagen** for images  
- It includes **Veo** for videos  
- It includes **Gemini Pro** for chat  
- It works on **mobile + laptop**  
- It has **no practical limits** for your usage  
- It includes **2 TB Google Drive**  
- Privacy is protected when “Gemini Apps Activity” is off  

This is the best “single subscription that does everything.”

# 🔒 Privacy (Your Concern)

You’re also correct here:

- **DeepSeek API** → enterprise‑grade privacy, no training on your code  
- **Gemini API** → enterprise‑grade privacy  
- **Gemini Advanced** → consumer privacy, but safe when activity is off  

For personal projects, all three are safe.  
For enterprise code, API usage is always the safest.
